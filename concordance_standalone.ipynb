    "This notebook is a Concordancer tool which allows users to upload text data (eg. .csv or .txt file) and to search the text for each instance of a search term, presenting it in the form of a concordance. The Concordancer retrieves all relevant instances of the search term and displays them for users in the tool as well as making them available for download as a CSV file for additional analysis. It has specifically been designed to allow users (i) to undertake ‘dialogic’ analysis (when the input consists of related text pairs, such as question-answer or social media post-response) and/or (ii) to make visible the meta-data that are associated with the occurrence of the search term (when available in the input; for example, speaker identity, political affiliation, company, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the data that is loaded into the notebook must contain ‘structured’ data, where one column consists of ‘text’ (eg the question or social media post) and the other columns consist of either the associated text of the dialogic pair (eg the relevant answer or the relevant reply/comment) or of metadata (describing aspects of the text). This is explained further below. In addition to this analysis of structured data, the notebook can create its own structured data based on symbols present in the uploaded text(s), automatically splitting the data preceding and following the relevant symbol (e.g. a colon or a question mark). This is also explained and illustrated further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, this notebook is not meant to feature all types of analyses offered by current off-the-shelf Concordancers and should be considered as complementary to such existing tools. You may want to use this tool if you are interested in using a Concordancer for dialogic analysis or exploring the relationship between search term and meta-data."
