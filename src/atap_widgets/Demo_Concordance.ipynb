Text files are a special mention, where symbols can be assigned which are used in the text to designate key- value pairs. If the symbol variable is inputed, DataIngest filters the text for these key-value pairs only and converts it into a dataframe object\n",

    "- If the word you are matching begins at the start of a group a larger chunk integer is suggested.\n",
    "- Lines are tagged with a --[line_number] symbol in the text (which can be removed). However, if the raw data has this symbol within the text it may be missleading."

      "PATRICIA KARVELAS, HOST: Labor played a key role in these chaotic scenes that saw National Party defector, Llew O'Brien, elected to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives this afternoon. Regardless of whether the nomination was a stunt, it's a reality now thanks to Labor's movements; and Llew O'Brien's new reality sees him pocket an extra $20,000 a year. So, all in all, not a bad outcome for him today. The distractions came as Australia's tertiary education sector struggles to come to terms with the prospect of a $3.1 billion hit from coronavirus. Tanya Plibersek is the Shadow Minister for Education and Training and former Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. She joins us this afternoon, Tanya, welcome.\n",
